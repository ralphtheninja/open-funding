## Introduction

More individuals, organizations and companies are starting to realize the potential of open source. An important question is obviously how projects can be funded to enable individuals to subsist and work on open source full time. This document aims to be an open guide to funding of open source projects.

## Grants

A list of funding opportunities that follow the grants model. This type of funding is usually carried out in batches, i.e. the fund in question release a certain amount of money each year and it's spread out over multiple projects. Grant funding often allows you to plan and execute projects over a longer period of time.

### [`Awesome Foundation`](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/)

#### About

Have a crazy brilliant idea that needs funding? We award 1,000 USD grants every month. It couldn't be simpler! Your idea is yours alone. We don't want a stake in it. We just want to help you make it happen!

#### Eligibility Criteria

Each fully autonomous chapter supports awesome projects through micro-grants, usually given out monthly. These micro-grants, 1000 USD or the local equivalent, come out of pockets of the chapter's "trustees" and are given on a no-strings-attached basis to people and groups working on awesome projects.
Every chapter interprets "awesome" for itself. As such, awesome projects include initiatives in a wide range of areas including arts, technology, community development, and more. Many awesome projects are novel or experimental, and evoke surprise and delight. Awesome sometimes challenges and often inspires.

### [`Chan Zuckerberg Initiative`](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/)

#### About

Open source software is crucial to modern scientific research, advancing biology and medicine while providing reproducibility and transparency. Yet even the most widely-used research software often lacks dedicated funding. CZI’s Essential Open Source Software for Science program supports software maintenance, growth, development, and community engagement for critical open source tools.

#### Eligibility Criteria

We welcome applications from any country, provided the proposed work is compliant with the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanctions program.
Applications may be submitted by non-profit and for-profit organizations, public and private institutions, such as colleges, universities, hospitals, laboratories, units of state and local government, companies, and eligible agencies of the federal government. As part of the full application process, for-profit organizations may need to provide additional information on the charitable purposes of the proposal. Grants are not permitted to individuals; only to organizations. Open source software projects operating independently must be affiliated with an organization, as described below.

#### Application

<https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/>

#### Deadline

Cycle 6 closed in October 2023.

### [`Code for Science and Society (CS&S)`](https://www.codeforsociety.org/)

#### About

Tackling the complex scientific challenges of the 21st century requires global, collaborative research networks with robust data science capacity. Data science community events are a key tool to build skills and networks.

People need money, time, and focused effort to build and sustain communities of practice with great events. This work is often under-resourced.

The Event Fund, established in 2019, fills this gap in the current data science landscape.
We offer grant funding (up to 20,000 USD) to support events bundled with cohort-based networking and training for event organizers.
Grantee organizers run impactful, inclusive events and build new connections around the world.

By investing directly in communities who seek to run inclusive events, the Event fund cultivates both data science skills and social infrastructure.

#### Eligibility Criteria

### [`DIIF - Digital Infrastructure Grants @ Open collective`](https://opencollective.com/di-grants)

#### About

Everything in our modern society, from hospitals and banks to universities and social media platforms, runs on software. Nearly all of this software is built on “digital infrastructure,” a foundation of free and public code that is designed to solve common challenges. The benefits of digital infrastructure are numerous: it can reduce the cost of setting up new businesses, support data-driven discovery across research disciplines, enable complex technologies such as smartphones to talk to each other, and allow everyone to have access to important innovations like encryption that would otherwise be too expensive. Sharing code to address common challenges is in principle cheaper, easier and more efficient.
While the collective action problems that characterize infrastructure funding are well-explored, the industrial organization of digital infrastructure is less well-understood. In 2016, the Ford Foundation funded a report by Nadia Eghbal titled “Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure” that described how that the development and maintenance of digital infrastructure often falls to communities of volunteers who take it upon themselves to maintain this infrastructure in their own free time and for little or no money. Unsurprisingly, this leads to significant risks to the open internet and the ability to develop new, innovative research and businesses within it.

In order to better understand the incentives and constraints that influence the maintenance of digital infrastructure, in 2018 the Sloan and Ford Foundations funded a portfolio of 13 research projects. In some cases the findings of these projects open up further questions, while in others they suggest interventions that could strengthen community practices.

To continue to advance this agenda, this RFP invited proposals to further study the maintenance of digital infrastructure. This new RFP is being funded again by Ford Foundation and Sloan Foundation as well as Mozilla, Omidyar and Open Society Foundations.

> Our 2024 RFP invites new proposals and research implementations to study the production, maintenance, governance and use of open digital infrastructure, looking at, but not limited to, the aspects listed in our Funding Scope.

- [Ford Foundation RFP](https://fordfoundation.forms.fm/2024-digital-infrastructure-insights-fund-rfp/forms/9861)

#### Eligibility Criteria

- Digital infrastructure projects
- Civic tech, environmental justice, globa, online infrastructure, open source, research, social justice

### [`Internet Freedom Support Fund @ Open collective`](https://opencollective.com/internet-freedom-support-fund)

#### About

Global internet freedom is more important than ever before. The internet is the primary way we communicate, collaborate, share knowledge and organize. We must therefore ensure it's freedom, openness, accessibility and privacy in order to revert the cycle of misinformation, polarization and the assault on our democracies occurring worldwide.

At the forefront of this work is the Open Technology Fund (OTF), whose mission has been to support open technologies and communities that increase free expression, circumvent censorship, and obstruct repressive surveillance as a way to promote human rights and open societies.

Through several funds and over the years, OTF funded  projects focused on counteracting repressive censorship and surveillance, enabling citizens worldwide to exercise their fundamental human rights online. Through the research, development, implementation, and sustainability of technologies that facilitate the free flow of information, increase at-risk users’ digital security, and enable free expression, the OTF community has been working to shape the Internet as a platform that fosters unimpeded connection and collaboration - facilitating positive social progress and reinforcing core democratic values.

Since the loss of government funding, many of these projects have seen their funding halted overnight and as a community we must come together and ensure their ability to continue doing this work. This lack of funding exposes a weakness in the global internet freedom ecosystem which needs to be resolved.

The Internet Freedom Support Fund will provide relief to projects essential to guarantee and increase internet freedom who have been receiving funding from OTF and have recently seen their funding cancelled due to OTF’s loss of government funds.

### [`PlaintextGroup`](https://github.com/PlaintextGroup/oss-virtual-incubator/)

#### About

We are seeking to support the most ambitious and innovative ideas to systemically improve the sustainability of the OSS ecosystem. Submit your idea or view other ideas here.
Discussion forum <https://github.com/PlaintextGroup/oss-virtual-incubator/discussions>

#### Eligibility Criteria

Like roads and bridges for the digital world, open source software (OSS) makes up much of our digital infrastructure and underlies many critical software systems, both public and private. Some of the most popular apps and websites are open source as well. Often referred to as "free and open source software" (FOSS), OSS can be used, modified, and shared by the public according to its terms of distribution.

However, OSS faces a sustainability problem. While some OSS projects are well-resourced by companies and non-profit organizations, other OSS code is maintained and released by people who struggle to monetize their work. Moreover, flaws in OSS has been used to mount supply chain attacks such as Heartbleed and, more recently, log4j. Traditional methods of resourcing OSS development and maintenance – such as corporate or philanthropic donations, crowdsourcing, or volunteer time – may not be enough.

We are seeking the most ambitious and innovative ideas to systemically improve the sustainability of the OSS ecosystem. We welcome ideas from around the world, and they can range from (but are not limited to) research proposals to specific technical improvements to institution-building to policymaking ideas. Here are some (not exhaustive) examples: "implement X feature in a certain package manager", "perform dependency mapping of the OSS ecosystem", "create a training program for OSS maintainers to learn how to apply to grants", "create a mechanism for the US National Science Foundation to better fund critical OSS libraries", "use X web3 mechanism to create incentives to fund OSS tools", "develop tools or new methodologies to predict open source sustainability or community health".

### [`Siegel Family Endowment`](https://www.siegelendowment.org/grantees/)

#### About

We know that philanthropy doesn’t hold all the answers to addressing tough societal challenges. However, we believe that philanthropy is uniquely positioned to ask big questions of our society, and to bring together the right stakeholders to answer those questions. Our inquiry-driven approach to grantmaking is an iterative process of asking questions, systematically interrogating them, and applying our learnings to subsequents rounds of questioning.

Our approach is grounded in the scientific method, and is inspired by our chairman and founder David Siegel’s approach to his life’s work. We ask questions that help us develop an informed hypothesis, support academic and field-work that uncovers evidence, track and interpret outcomes thoughtfully, and apply our findings in order to inform the next phase of inquiry.
<https://www.siegelendowment.org/our-interest-areas/infrastructure/>

We were founded in 2014 at the initiative of SIDN (Stichting Internet Domeinregistratie Nederland) and since the first call in 2015 we have supported more than 300 projects.
<https://www.sidnfonds.nl/aanvragen/pioniers>
ttps\://[www.sidnfonds.nl/excerpt/](http://www.sidnfonds.nl/excerpt/)

From their webpage:

> SIDN Fund does not support internationally oriented projects. To qualify for support, a project should have impact on Dutch society.

> SIDN Fund stands for ‘a strong internet for all’. We provide financial support to ideas and projects that aim to make the internet stronger or that use the internet in innovative ways. By doing so, SIDN Fund wants to help increase the social impact of the internet in the Netherlands.

Similarly to `InnovationsFonden`, `SIDN` also funds projects on different levels. Smaller projects - `Pioneer projects` - can receive a maximum of 10k EUR and larger projects - `Potentials projects` - up to 75k EUR.

#### Eligibility Criteria

You are eligible for our support if your innovative project serves a social interest, has the potential to make an impact on one of our focus areas and can continue to exist after our funding period. Moreover, it is essential that the results of your project are shared, as is the knowledge and experience gained. We take the following general criteria into account when assessing an application. Please note: additional criteria are sometimes set for theme calls.

### [`Shuttleworth Foundation`](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/)

#### About

The free and open source software (FOSS) movement has not only created widely used software but million dollar businesses, using collaborative development approaches and open licences. Although the model is well established for software, it is not the case for education, philanthropy, hardware or social development. The default imposed on knowledge resources by copyright law is automatic lock down, with ideas generated and owned by 'experts'. This default makes little sense if your agenda is social change.

We identify amazing people with innovative ideas and give them a fellowship grant, project funding and a support system of like-minded individuals.

If we are deliberate about finding great people, supporting and sharing their positive approaches for social change, the world will get better, faster. That is why we are looking for social innovators who are open at heart, have a fresh perspective on addressing challenges and have a very clear idea of their role in bringing about positive change.

### [`Sloan Foundation`](https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology/better-software-for-science)

#### About

We fund research and education in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and economics

##### 1. Better Software for Science

###### Open source in research

Open source is much more than a licensing strategy, it is a set of community practices that enable the distributed production and maintenance of software that are not widely adopted in the research enterprise. The Better Software for Science program seeks opportunities to better understand and align best practices in open source with academic research, with a particular eye toward the health and maintenance of digital infrastructural dependencies upon which computational research relies.

###### Software Publication and Archiving

Software is not well-integrated into the scholarly communication system; scientific software is often not cited or well-archived, and can require substantial work to reuse. The Better Software for Science program seeks opportunities to elevate software as a first-order research product as well as efforts that aim to improve the linkages between software and other research outputs such as articles, preprints or data.

###### Career paths and incentives

The work of building and maintaining research software is often undervalued and marginalized in the research enterprise. The Better Software for Science program seeks opportunities to foreground and institutionalize the individuals and communities who are essential to the utility and durability of software in science, with particular attention to the roles of research software engineer, data scientist, and software curator.

##### 2. Exploratory grant making in technology

###### Open Hardware

Open and cheap hardware has the potential to revolutionize the creation and deployment of sensors and other scientific instruments, expanding access and lowering barriers to innovation in data-driven research methods. Grants in this focus area seek to explore the potential for Foundation support to have an impact on the development of best practices, data standards, and emerging new practitioner communities in open hardware.

###### Trust in Algorithmic Knowledge

The complexity and opacity of AI-driven research methods has raised new questions about the degree to which their results can or should be trusted. Issues examined in this focus area include identifying and mitigating algorithmic bias, the role of training and benchmarking datasets in AI development, how Machine Learning techniques enhance or degrade rigor and reproducibility, and the ways that algorithmic recommendation systems influence trust in knowledge.  Grants focus on exploring these issues with an eye toward understanding the potential for Foundation impact.

###### Virtual Collaboration

Health, safety, and travel restrictions imposed in response to the global coronavirus pandemic made co-located scientific activities impossible. From conferences to classrooms to lab work, research communities responded by using new approaches and technology platforms to continue the practice of science. Grants in this focus area explore these innovations, their effects on research outcomes, and their post-pandemic durability, and encourage continued experimentation by research communities in how scientific practice might be effectively mediated by digital platforms and immersive technologies.

##### 3. Data & computational research

Grants in this program sought to partner with research communities to develop tools, standards, practices, and institutions that enable the efficient management and sharing of data and code at every point in the scientific pipeline—from acquisition through analysis to archiving.

- <https://sloan.org/grants/apply>
- <https://www.softwareheritage.org/2020/05/20/welcoming-sloan-support-to-expand-the-software-heritage-archive/>

#### Eligibility Criteria

In selecting projects for funding, the Foundation seeks proposals for original initiatives led by outstanding individuals or teams.  We are interested in projects that have a high expected return to society, exhibit a high degree of methodological rigor, and for which funding from the private sector, government, or other foundations is not yet widely available.

The Foundation does not generally make grants to for-profit institutions.

From their [webpage](https://sloan.org/fellowships):

> The Sloan Research Fellowships seek to stimulate fundamental research by early-career scientists and scholars of outstanding promise.

and:

> These two-year fellowships are awarded yearly to 126 researchers in recognition of distinguished performance and a unique potential to make substantial contributions to their field. The 2018 Sloan Research Fellows will receive fellowships in the amount of $65,000

### [`Web3 Foundation Grants`](https://web3.foundation/)

#### About

As part of our commitment to promoting the Web3 ecosystem, we offer a comprehensive grants program focused on funding software development and research efforts related to Polkadot and Kusama.
You don't need to start your own project in order to be eligible for a grant. Instead, some teams choose to port existing work to Substrate, where the pertinent licenses allow, or even to contribute to an existing open-source project. In the latter case, you should check in advance that the maintainers of the project are interested in your contribution, and the acceptance of the milestones will generally be tied to the inclusion of your work in said project. See the Maintenance Grants section for more info.

- <https://medium.com/web3foundation/wrap-up-for-winter-with-our-wave-four-grant-recipients-52c27b831a6e>

#### Eligibility Criteria

Generally, your project will have better chances to be accepted if:

It presents a well-researched or tested concept, for which ideally you are able to show some prior work.
You can demonstrate that the project will be maintained after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources or an existing business model.
Your team has proven experience with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. You will be asked to provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application, which we will examine for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
Your application is rich in technical details and well-defined.
You can clearly present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.
Additionally, it must fulfill the following requirements:

All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3, MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable.
We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale.
Applications must not mention a specific token. Furthermore, the focus of the application should lie on the software that is being implemented/research being carried out as part of the grant, and less on your project/venture/operation. For the purpose of the application and delivery, think about how others might also benefit from your work.
As a general rule, teams are asked to finish a grant before applying for another one.
Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering or criminal activities in general.

### [`Cisco Research Grants`](https://research.cisco.com/open-rfps)

#### About

##### Sustainability

Information technology systems and infrastructures represent, by some estimates, approximately 4% of the net contribution towards greenhouse gas emissions. While actions can be undertaken to reduce both the energy required for power and cooling, as well as reducing the embedded emissions, ICT infrastructures offer the potential to help reduce the resource consumption and emissions from other sources of activity. In other words, we may see ICT sector emission increasing while other sectors decrease. 'No decarbonization without digitalization'.

As Sustainability rises on the global agenda, Cisco is interested in how information and communication technologies can be improved in efficiency and how ICT can enable a more sustainable future for the world.

The goal of this RFP is to solicit proposals that aim to conduct research in information and communications technologies (ICTs) and their application towards more sustainable outcomes. Specific areas of research include but are not limited to the following:

Sustainable data, computing and communications architectures and infrastructures: datacenters, clouds and edge as well as novel network designs
Sustainable and energy-efficient systems: computing, communications, networking, storage, etc.
The application of AI/ML to enable improved sustainability outcomes

Security considerations for distributed infrastructures and systems such as energy generation and distribution
Business models and information systems for sustainability and circularity
Human factors in design of improved product sustainability

##### Web 3

Web 3.0 has disrupted the technological ecosystem and geoeconomics worldwide. A parallel digital economy was born out of bitcoin, and then continues to grow with the help of Ethereum and other cryptocurrency (aka virtual-currency) platforms. They have given rise to the concept of de-centralized finance (DeFI) technology. De-centralized computing is enabled by blockchain and is being implemented as de-centralized apps (dApps). While the industry is building the Web3.0 technology and building on top of the continuously evolving Web3.0 platforms, there are several research challenges that need to be addressed. Cisco is interested in helping the industry solve the foundational and applied technical problems and in advancing the technology of Web 3.0.

The goal of this RFP is to solicit proposals that aim to conduct research and address research challenges in the technologies and applications in the area of Web 3.0, Blockchain, cryptocurrencies aka virtual-currencies. Specific areas of research include but are not limited to the following:

There are different models, the traditional crowdfunded project asks for funds given some budget and project proposition. If the project reach the donation goal you can receive extra benefits apart from the actual product.

Other models are more focused on the community, where members of the community pitch in a certain amount of money per time unit, e.g. once a month.
