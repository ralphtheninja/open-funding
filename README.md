## Introduction

More individuals, organizations and companies are starting to realize the potential of open source. An important question is obviously how projects can be funded to enable individuals to subsist and work on open source full time. This document aims to be an open guide to funding of open source projects.

## Grants

A list of funding opportunities that follow the grants model. This type of funding is usually carried out in batches, i.e. the fund in question release a certain amount of money each year and it's spread out over multiple projects. Grant funding often allows you to plan and execute projects over a longer period of time.

### [`Awesome Foundation`](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/)

#### About

Have a crazy brilliant idea that needs funding? We award 1,000 USD grants every month. It couldn't be simpler! Your idea is yours alone. We don't want a stake in it. We just want to help you make it happen!

#### Eligibility Criteria

Each fully autonomous chapter supports awesome projects through micro-grants, usually given out monthly. These micro-grants, 1000 USD or the local equivalent, come out of pockets of the chapter's "trustees" and are given on a no-strings-attached basis to people and groups working on awesome projects.
Every chapter interprets "awesome" for itself. As such, awesome projects include initiatives in a wide range of areas including arts, technology, community development, and more. Many awesome projects are novel or experimental, and evoke surprise and delight. Awesome sometimes challenges and often inspires.

### [`Internet Freedom Support Fund @ Open collective`](https://opencollective.com/internet-freedom-support-fund)

#### About

Global internet freedom is more important than ever before. The internet is the primary way we communicate, collaborate, share knowledge and organize. We must therefore ensure it's freedom, openness, accessibility and privacy in order to revert the cycle of misinformation, polarization and the assault on our democracies occurring worldwide.

At the forefront of this work is the Open Technology Fund (OTF), whose mission has been to support open technologies and communities that increase free expression, circumvent censorship, and obstruct repressive surveillance as a way to promote human rights and open societies.

Through several funds and over the years, OTF funded  projects focused on counteracting repressive censorship and surveillance, enabling citizens worldwide to exercise their fundamental human rights online. Through the research, development, implementation, and sustainability of technologies that facilitate the free flow of information, increase at-risk users’ digital security, and enable free expression, the OTF community has been working to shape the Internet as a platform that fosters unimpeded connection and collaboration - facilitating positive social progress and reinforcing core democratic values.

Since the loss of government funding, many of these projects have seen their funding halted overnight and as a community we must come together and ensure their ability to continue doing this work. This lack of funding exposes a weakness in the global internet freedom ecosystem which needs to be resolved.

The Internet Freedom Support Fund will provide relief to projects essential to guarantee and increase internet freedom who have been receiving funding from OTF and have recently seen their funding cancelled due to OTF’s loss of government funds.

We know that philanthropy doesn’t hold all the answers to addressing tough societal challenges. However, we believe that philanthropy is uniquely positioned to ask big questions of our society, and to bring together the right stakeholders to answer those questions. Our inquiry-driven approach to grantmaking is an iterative process of asking questions, systematically interrogating them, and applying our learnings to subsequents rounds of questioning.

Our approach is grounded in the scientific method, and is inspired by our chairman and founder David Siegel’s approach to his life’s work. We ask questions that help us develop an informed hypothesis, support academic and field-work that uncovers evidence, track and interpret outcomes thoughtfully, and apply our findings in order to inform the next phase of inquiry.

### [`Sloan Foundation`](https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology/better-software-for-science)

#### About

We fund research and education in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and economics

##### 1. Better Software for Science

###### Open source in research

Open source is much more than a licensing strategy, it is a set of community practices that enable the distributed production and maintenance of software that are not widely adopted in the research enterprise. The Better Software for Science program seeks opportunities to better understand and align best practices in open source with academic research, with a particular eye toward the health and maintenance of digital infrastructural dependencies upon which computational research relies.

###### Software Publication and Archiving

Software is not well-integrated into the scholarly communication system; scientific software is often not cited or well-archived, and can require substantial work to reuse. The Better Software for Science program seeks opportunities to elevate software as a first-order research product as well as efforts that aim to improve the linkages between software and other research outputs such as articles, preprints or data.

###### Career paths and incentives

The work of building and maintaining research software is often undervalued and marginalized in the research enterprise. The Better Software for Science program seeks opportunities to foreground and institutionalize the individuals and communities who are essential to the utility and durability of software in science, with particular attention to the roles of research software engineer, data scientist, and software curator.

##### 2. Exploratory grant making in technology

###### Open Hardware

Open and cheap hardware has the potential to revolutionize the creation and deployment of sensors and other scientific instruments, expanding access and lowering barriers to innovation in data-driven research methods. Grants in this focus area seek to explore the potential for Foundation support to have an impact on the development of best practices, data standards, and emerging new practitioner communities in open hardware.

###### Trust in Algorithmic Knowledge

The complexity and opacity of AI-driven research methods has raised new questions about the degree to which their results can or should be trusted. Issues examined in this focus area include identifying and mitigating algorithmic bias, the role of training and benchmarking datasets in AI development, how Machine Learning techniques enhance or degrade rigor and reproducibility, and the ways that algorithmic recommendation systems influence trust in knowledge.  Grants focus on exploring these issues with an eye toward understanding the potential for Foundation impact.

###### Virtual Collaboration

Health, safety, and travel restrictions imposed in response to the global coronavirus pandemic made co-located scientific activities impossible. From conferences to classrooms to lab work, research communities responded by using new approaches and technology platforms to continue the practice of science. Grants in this focus area explore these innovations, their effects on research outcomes, and their post-pandemic durability, and encourage continued experimentation by research communities in how scientific practice might be effectively mediated by digital platforms and immersive technologies.

##### 3. Data & computational research

Grants in this program sought to partner with research communities to develop tools, standards, practices, and institutions that enable the efficient management and sharing of data and code at every point in the scientific pipeline—from acquisition through analysis to archiving.

- <https://www.softwareheritage.org/2020/05/20/welcoming-sloan-support-to-expand-the-software-heritage-archive/>

#### Eligibility Criteria

In selecting projects for funding, the Foundation seeks proposals for original initiatives led by outstanding individuals or teams.  We are interested in projects that have a high expected return to society, exhibit a high degree of methodological rigor, and for which funding from the private sector, government, or other foundations is not yet widely available.

The Foundation does not generally make grants to for-profit institutions.

From their [webpage](https://sloan.org/fellowships):

> The Sloan Research Fellowships seek to stimulate fundamental research by early-career scientists and scholars of outstanding promise.

and:

> These two-year fellowships are awarded yearly to 126 researchers in recognition of distinguished performance and a unique potential to make substantial contributions to their field. The 2018 Sloan Research Fellows will receive fellowships in the amount of $65,000

There is also a [grant program](https://sloan.org/grants/apply), but [individuals are excluded](https://sloan.org/grants/apply#tab-what-we-do-not-fund)

> does not make grants to individuals except through its Books program

#### Application

Interested grantseekers should send a two-page letter of inquiry to <technology@sloan.org>. After that follows the real grant proposal process

Letter of Inquiry should include (1 or max 2 pages)

A brief statement (1-2 sentences) about the nature and purpose of the proposed project;
A description of the proposed work to be supported;
An estimate of the total cost of the project and the amount of this total the proposer would likely seek from the Sloan Foundation;
An estimate of the duration of the project;

### [`Web3 Foundation Grants`](https://web3.foundation/)

#### About

As part of our commitment to promoting the Web3 ecosystem, we offer a comprehensive grants program focused on funding software development and research efforts related to Polkadot and Kusama.
You don't need to start your own project in order to be eligible for a grant. Instead, some teams choose to port existing work to Substrate, where the pertinent licenses allow, or even to contribute to an existing open-source project. In the latter case, you should check in advance that the maintainers of the project are interested in your contribution, and the acceptance of the milestones will generally be tied to the inclusion of your work in said project. See the Maintenance Grants section for more info.

- <https://medium.com/web3foundation/wrap-up-for-winter-with-our-wave-four-grant-recipients-52c27b831a6e>

#### Eligibility Criteria

Generally, your project will have better chances to be accepted if:

It presents a well-researched or tested concept, for which ideally you are able to show some prior work.
You can demonstrate that the project will be maintained after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources or an existing business model.
Your team has proven experience with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. You will be asked to provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application, which we will examine for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
Your application is rich in technical details and well-defined.
You can clearly present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.
Additionally, it must fulfill the following requirements:

All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3, MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable.
We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale.
Applications must not mention a specific token. Furthermore, the focus of the application should lie on the software that is being implemented/research being carried out as part of the grant, and less on your project/venture/operation. For the purpose of the application and delivery, think about how others might also benefit from your work.
As a general rule, teams are asked to finish a grant before applying for another one.
Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering or criminal activities in general.
